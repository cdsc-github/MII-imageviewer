/**
 * A simplified version of GLJPanel that allows for easy mixing of 2D and 3D
 * elements in a Swing application.  The intention of this class is to lower
 * the barrier of entry for developers who are familiar with Java2D and Swing
 * but less familiar with OpenGL and JOGL.  This class handles much of the
 * "dirty work" so that the developer can concentrate more on adding content
 * than on (potentially confusing) OpenGL concepts.
 * <p>
 * This class has two modes:
 * <ul>
 * <li> 2D mode, which uses an orthographic projection to allow for rendering
 *      two-dimensional content via OpenGL.  This mode allows developers to
 *      use JOGL to render more complex two-dimensional elements in an
 *      existing Java2D scene.  For example, one could use OpenGL fragment
 *      shaders to achieve advanced visual effects.
 * <li> 3D mode, which uses a perspective projection to allow for rendering
 *      three-dimensional content via OpenGL.  This mode allows developers to
 *      use JOGL to render three-dimensional elements above, below, or
 *      alongside other two-dimensional elements.  For example, one could use
 *      OpenGL to render a complex 3D scene, and then use Java2D and Swing
 *      to overlay a translucent "heads-up" display over the 3D scene.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In both modes, it is possible to mix Java2D, Swing, and JOGL elements.  To
 * simplify this process (and to help guide the developer), this class defines
 * four protected methods that can be overridden by the developer, which are
 * called in (approximately) the following order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@code render2DBackground()}
 * <li>{@code init3DResources()}
 * <li>{@code render3DScene()}
 * <li>{@code render2DForeground()}
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Most developers should only need to concern themselves with these four
 * methods.  Only advanced users should find it necessary to call or
 * override the other public methods in this class.
